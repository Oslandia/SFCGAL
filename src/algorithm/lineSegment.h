 * @brief Retrieve a segment of a specified LineString,

 *   of the specified LineString.
 * @param ls The specified LineString.
 * @param start The fraction along the specified LineString defining the
 *   start of the desired segment.
 * @param end The fraction along the specified LineString defining the
 *   end of the desired segment.
 * @note Negative values of {@code start} and/or {@code end} will be
 *   interpreted as a fractional distance taken from the end of the
 *   specified LineString. +/-0 will always be interpreted as the start
 *   of {@code ls}.
 * @note For open lines, a negative length range will result in a line
 *   segment terminating at the specified points, but with an
 *   orientation reversed relative to {@code ls}. For closed lines the
 *   a negative range corresponds to the complentary section of {@code ls}
 *   with an orientation equal to that of it.
 * @return The specified line segment.
 * @throws If either {@code start} or {@code end} have an absolute value
 *   greater than 1.
